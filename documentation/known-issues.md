### _Bugs that we're aware of but haven't fixed yet_

- The decision assistant may accept an answer that is clearly indicated in the category name i.e. "William" alone being correct for the category "Famous Williams"
- "getWeightedRandomKey" error when using custom game settings
- Double tap for selecting clues doesn't always work, should probably be single tap instead
