# Roadmap
### _Long term plan for future updates_

## "Definitely Happening"
- Public leaderboards (daily/monthly/all time)
    - Condition: Games must be normal mode. Players must not have earned more than $2000 from decision reversals
    - Maybe other conditions to detect cheating... somehow? Or at least make a good guess
- Answer streaks for giving consecutive correct responses
- End-of-game badges rewarding things like accuracy in a certain category type, or wager bravery. Just for fun in normal mode, worth money in party mode
- User accounts to save historical game stats
- Ability to upload your own trivia categories for flashcard studying, class lessons, etc.
- Expanded party mode (new clue bonuses and round types i.e. a round where each player gets to choose their own category type)

## "I'm Just A Bill"
- Round type (a la Trivial Pursuit) where players choose questions by category type and earn more than other players for getting their own selection correct
- "Battle royale" round type where the hindmost player is eliminated periodically
- Different background animations depending on game context (i.e. text particles saying "round 2" when the round switches over)
