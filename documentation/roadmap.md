# Roadmap
### _Long term plan for future updates_

- New and improved user interface worthy of the re-built server
- New tech to handle "tossups" (i.e. players all buzzing around the same instant). Basically, your odds of winning a tossup improve each consecutive time you lose one
- User accounts to save historical game stats
- Public leaderboards including more detailed stats like category type accuracy (i.e. this players answers 85% of their geography attempts correctly)
- Ability to upload your own trivia categories (in an accessible format like .json or something) for flashcard studying, class lessons, etc.
- Expanded party mode (new clue bonuses and round types i.e. a round where each player gets to choose their own category type)
- Answer streaks for giving consecutive correct responses
